    Hello World!<br />
I am vlad "fiveguyslover" and I am 18 years old.<br />
I am a web developer and I do websec in my spare time.<br /><br />
I do security challenges and bug bounty, I was even recognized as the researcher of the month (April 2021) by the US Department of Defense.<br />Here is the tweet that proves it : <a href="https://twitter.com/dc3vdp/status/1389209564302790658" target="_blank">tweet</a><br />
<br />I specialize in front-end (HTML, CSS, JS, React) because I think it's really cool and I'm very interested in Web3, I have a relatively solid base in Solidity.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to pass all the challenges around Ethereum on Root-Me.<br /><br />I was also lucky enough to find big vulnerabilities on Coca-Cola (an XSS on all sites with a CloudFront bypass, as well as an SQLi), on Sixt, BMW, IBM, and other platforms such as US and French government sites.<br /><br />

Here are my profiles : <br />
